\subsection{Single-Line Diagrams}

\begin{define}
    \textbf{Single-line diagram:} representation of an electrical system, providing a view of its components, interconnections, and electrical flow paths

    \textbf{Bus:} in an electrical system, this is a node where several line or several lines are connected. In power systems specifically, this is any garph node of the single-line diagram at which voltage, curernt, power flow or other quantities can be evaluated
\end{define}
Components on a single-line diagram
\begin{itemize}
    \item Power sources - includes generators, utility supplies and indicates their voltage levels and connection points to the electrical system
    \item Electrical Equipment - includes transformers, circuit breakers, switches, motors, and loads
    \item Bus arrangement - includes bus bars for power distribution at different voltage levels and shows how power is routed from one location to another
    \item Protective devices - includes fuses, circuit breakers, and relays
    \item Metering/instrumentation - includes metering devices (ammeter, voltmeter etc) and measuring points for monitoring/control
\end{itemize}

Bus Arrangement and Voltage Levels
\begin{define}
    Bus duct  
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Carries high currents between different electrical components and sections
        \item Ensures efficient power distribution and reduce
    \end{itemize}
    Transformer 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used to step down or setp up voltage levels
        \item Placed at locations to convert high-voltage power from the utility grid to lower voltages or to increase voltage for long-distance Transmission
        \item Winding figurations, type, kVA ratings, cool methods, and surge/lightning protection devices are listed
    \end{itemize}
    Voltage/current transformers (VT, CT)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Used to measure voltage and current lvels for metering, protection, and control purposes
    \end{itemize}
\end{define}
